# 2024 - 2025 Project-1 FPGA Frogger Team-8 - Project Charter

## Project definition

This project aims to create a clone of the classic video game Frogger.

## Scope

This project should be done using Verilog and run on the NANDLAND FPGA Go Board and a VGA screen.

This implementation should only the basic functionality of the game at first. Movement, enemies and win, lose condition.

## Project Plan

This project will be using the waterfall project method due to the limited timeframe. However, we plan to use some aspects of SCRUM management with iterations over an MVP. This incrementation will limit the number of bugs by allowing regression testing.

The planning will be made by defining the tasks and objectives pointed out in the brief and during the meeting. Each of these will be sorted by importance and distributed accordingly. To manage them, we will use a GitHub project in our repository to centralize all the resources. Additional management tools will be used to track the achievements and bottlenecks during the project.

After the final presentation which will take place on October, 25th 2024, we will do a post-mortem analysis to summarize what happened.

## Deliverables

The main deliverable is the source code of the application. In addition, to ensure we stay on the right track, we will submit multiple mock-ups and prototypes to the client.

Additional documents will be given to the client:

- Functional Specification
- Technical Specification
- Test Plan
- User Manual
- Management Planning & Weekly reports

In addition, a presentation of our work will be done to the client as a 15-minute long presentation.
