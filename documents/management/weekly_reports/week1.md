# Weekly Report - Week 1

## Overview

This week marked the beginning of our project with a strong focus on the kick-off and initial planning stages.
A most of the week was spent learning about the technology.

## Accomplishments

1. **Project Kick-off**
   - The client provided a detailed requirement, clarifying their expectations and addressing any ambiguities from the initial brief.
2. **Planning**
   - We outlined the project's steps and created a comprehensive Gantt Chart to guide our timeline and milestones.
3. **Learning the technology**
   - We add classes about the technology, it was needed as FPGA is very diferent from traditional programming
4. **Functional Specifications**
   - We have drafted most of the functional specifications document, laying a solid foundation for the technical specifications.
5. **VGA Screen**
   - A white square could be displayed in different part of the screen

## Challenges

1. **New Team Dynamics**
   - As a newly formed team, with many first-year students, we spent time understanding our roles and responsibilities, requiring substantial initial research.
2. **Learning Verilog**
   - While Verilog is relatively straightforward, the underlying FPGA technology is not.

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Complete Functional Specifications**
   - Finalize the functional specifications, allowing room for adjustments as the project progresses.
2. **Advance Development**
   - With the FPGA technology better understood by the team, we can start development. 
3. **Conduct Risk Evaluation**
   - Identify potential risks and develop mitigation strategies to maintain transparency and manage expectations with the client.

## Conclusion

The project has had a promising start with strong team spirit and effective communication. The team is learning the technology and outlining the specifications
