## 1 - Project definitions

## 1.1 - What is this project?

This project is a reproduction of the game "Frogger" published in 1981 by Konami.

## 1.2 - Provided hardware

### 1.2.1 - Go boards

For this project, we were given a total of 7 [go boards](https://nandland.com/the-go-board/) which can be programmed using Verilog[^1].

A go board is an FPGA[^2] that can be reprogrammed at any time. it has been created by the company [NandLand](https://nandland.com/) to allow students and beginners to learn about FPGAs[^2].

Along with the boards we were given 7 books written by Russell MERRICK, our teacher for this project. This book contains the different usages and subtleties of Verilog.

The default parameters of the go board remain unchanged.

### 1.2.2 - Screen

We were also given a screen of  640 pixels width by 480 pixels height, along with a VGA cable to connect a board to the screen,

## 2 - Development environment

### 2.1 - Computers

Our team uses multiple machines to work on this project, such as:
- 2 IBM-compatible laptops operating on Windows 11,
- 5 MacBooks operating on MacOS Sequoia 15.0.

As for the IDE, we are using Visual Studio Code. Finally, to be able to upload a program to the board we all installed the tool [Apio](https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio/) on our machines.

### 2.2 - Programming language

#### 2.2.1 - What is Verilog?

The programming language used for this project is Verilog. It is a programming language specialised in the programming of FPGAs[^2]. Verilog possesses multiple particularities listed as:
- There is no order of execution, meaning that all lines present in a module are executed simultaneously, the only exceptions being the lines requiring specific conditions such as "always" and if-else conditions.
- Verilog belongs to a type of programming languages known as "hardware description languages" which are languages that are used to model electronic systems. Although the language is easier to read than assembly languages due to a syntax similar to C-like languages it manages component in a lower level than assembly language as it interacts directly with wires.

#### 2.2.2 - Why Verilog?

Verilog is not the only HDL to exist, VHDL is another popular HDL compatible with our programming board. Here is the list following the reasoning as to why we are using Verilog:
- The use of Verilog is a requirement of the project.
- Verilog is the most popular hardware description language when working on FPGAs[^2].

## 3 - Development rules

In order to keep the repository clean and maintainable, we choose to follow specific conventions.

### 3.1 Naming conventions

Here is the list of the naming conventions regarding the repository and the file architecture of the project:
- **Branches**: pascalCase,
- **Folder & files**: snake_case,

Here is the naming conventions regarding Verilog:
- **Modules[^3]**: snake_case,
- **Wires**: w_[Name],
- **Registers**: r_[Name],
- **Inputs**: i_[Name],
- **Outputs**: o_[Name],
- **Parameters & defines**: [NAME].

Note that [Name] symbolises the name given to the element. \
e.g: 
```
reg r_Clock;
parameter MYPARAM = 20;
```

### 3.2 Comments

The use of comments is crucial for the maintainability of a project is the use of comments. It allows collaborators and future developer to maintain and update the code without struggling on understanding the inner part of a program.

In Verilog comments can be written in multiple ways: 

In a Verilog file:
``` 
// This is a single line comment

/*
This is a multiline
comment
*/
```

In a PCF file:
```
## This is a comment
```

Comments should be regularly written to ensure the comprehension of the code of current and future developers and reviewers. 

### 3.3 - Syntax conventions

## Glossary
[^1]: Verilog: A programming language used to program and/or simulate circuit boards. Verilog is notably used with specific hardware such as FPGAs[^2].
[^2]: FPGA: A Field-Programmable Gate Array is a type of integrated circuit that can be programmed after manufacturing, it is notably used to create satellites, military equipment, or other devices requiring low-latency operations.
[^3]: Module: The equivalent of other languages' functions. It is used to create and store the logic of the program.
