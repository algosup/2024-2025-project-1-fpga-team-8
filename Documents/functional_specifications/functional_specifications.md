### 1.1 Overview

"Frogger FPGA" is a project aimed at creating a fun and interactive Frogger game using FPGA technology and Verilog programming language. In this classic arcade-style game, a player guides a frog across a busy road filled with moving cars and navigates a river with logs and other obstacles. The goal is to reach the other side while avoiding hazards safely. This project prioritizes an engaging gaming experience while also showcasing the power of FPGA for real-time applications.

_A logo of the game is shown below:_

</div>

### 1.2 Purpose

This project is an opportunity for us to dive deeper into Verilog programming and FPGA technology. Our main goal is to create a fun and exciting Frogger game that can be displayed on a 640x480 VGA monitor. The game involves a frog crossing a road filled with obstacles, focusing on delivering a smooth, engaging experience for users.

While the primary objective is to get the core gameplay functioning, we’re also considering adding more detailed graphics and possibly arcade features. However, adding sound falls outside the scope of this project.

### 1.3 Out of Scope

- <u>Arcade Cabinet:</u>
  An arcade cabinet would have a joystick and screen integrated into a casing to hide the entire system.<br>The arcade would make the game easier to play and make the system less intimidating for non-technical people. However, such an endeavor would involve fabrication skills and resources beyond what is available to the team.

- <u>Sounds:</u>
  Sound effects and Music would add a sense of life to the game and make it closer to the original experience.<br>The hardware available doesn't support sound. In addition, the benefits don't justify the effort of implementing a sound system from scratch.

- <u>Leaderboard:</u>
  A leaderboard would allow us to save and display the best score on the screen.<br>This could make the game more attractive and more competitive. But those aren't the objectives of the project so it shouldn't be implemented.

- <u>Multi-language support:</u>
  The game start button is "start" which means that the game isn't quite language agnostic. A multilingual solution would be a solution to remedy this issue.<br>This solution is high effort and wasteful as it would require adding a language selection menu. Whereas simply making the game language agnostic could be done by changing the start button.

## 2. Frogger game

### 2.1 Game Objective

To complete a level, the player must guide five frogs safely into the home bays. Each frog represents a life, and the player starts with four lives. The game ends when all frogs are lost or when the player completes all the levels. Additionally, Frogger has a time limit of 30 seconds (or 60 ticks) per frog, shown by a time band at the bottom of the screen. The remaining time also contributes to the player’s score if the frog reaches a home bay on time. This remain the same throughout all the levels.

</div>

### 2.2 Gameplay Mechanics

#### 2.2.1 Gameplay movement

The frog advances one tile per button press. When the frog reaches the top row of the screen and completes the level, the frog is automatically repositioned at the bottom to begin the next level.

_Frog:_

<div align="center">

![frog](./images/frog.png)

</div>

#### 2.2.2 Gameplay controls

The player controls Frogger using the four buttons on the FPGA system. These buttons allow movement in four directions: up, down, left, and right.

_FPGA BUTTONS:_

<div align="center">

![FPGA](./images/fpga.jpg)

</div>

#### 2.2.3 Highway Crossing

The player begins each round by moving the frog through a four-lane highway. Cars and trucks move horizontally across the screen in both directions at varying speeds. Traffic patterns vary in speed and direction, presenting a continuous challenge for the player to navigate without getting squashed. If the frog touches any vehicle, the player loses a life.

Each forward jump earns the player 10 points. Completing this section will lead the players to the next section.

_Highway:_

<div align="center">

![road](./images/road.png)

</div>

- **Key hazards:**
  - Vehicles: There are five different types of vehicles in the game, all equally deadly. If Frogger comes into contact with any of them, he will be crushed, resulting in the loss of a life.

| **Car 4** | ![car4](./images/car4.png)   | **32x32** pixels <br> 1 tile  | - Placed on **lane 5** <br> - Travels from **left to right** <br> - The **fastest** car out of all                                             |
| **Truck** | ![truck](./images/truck.png) | **64x32** pixels <br> 2 tiles | - Placed on **lane 6** <br> - Travels from **right to left** <br> - **Slowest** moving vehicle                                                 |

The speed of each of these vehicles increases with each level, as detailed further in the document in the section [Game Levels (1-8)](#game-levels-1-8).

#### 2.2.4 River Crossing

After crossing the highway, Frogger reaches the riverbank. To get to the home bays, the player must jump across floating logs, turtles, and other moving objects.
These logs vary in speed and direction, while turtles periodically dive underwater, requiring the player to hop off before they disappear.

Additional river hazards include snapping alligator jaws that can appear while Frogger is on logs. As the game progresses, new threats like fast-moving otters emerge, capable of pulling the frog into the water, increasing the challenge.

The river is divided into 7 rows:

- First row: The riverbank—a relatively safe area where the snake begins spawning after level 3.
- Second row: Contains sets of three turtles.
- Third row: Consists of short logs only.
- Fourth row: Consists of long logs only.
- Fifth row: Contains sets of two turtles.
- Sixth row: Consists of medium logs only.
- Seventh row: The goal, with five safe spots (home bays) that Frogger must fill. The grass here is unsafe, and enemies or bonuses may also appear.

_River Bank:_

<div align="center">

![river](./images/river.png)

</div>

**Logs**:

Logs come in three different sizes and shapes: short, medium, and long. Frogger can safely land on these logs without falling into the water, as they float from left to right across the screen.

Frogger can to jump side to side while on a log, but be careful not to fall into the water. Additionally, Frogger can leap from one log to another floating object, moving forward or backward.

_Logs_:

<div align="center">

![log1](./images/log1.png) <br>
![log2](./images/log2.png) <br>
![log3](./images/log3.png)

</div>

**Small logs:**

A small log spans the equivalent of 2 tiles.
Thus 64x32 pixels.

![smalllog1](./images/smalllog.png)

**Medium logs:**

A medium log spans the equivalent of 3 tiles.
Thus 96x32 pixels.

<div align="center">

![mediumlog1](./images/mediumlog.png)

</div>

**Long Logs:**

A long log spans the equivalent of 5 tiles.
Thus 160x32 pixels.

![longlog1](./images/longlog.png)

**Key hazards**:

- **Diving Turtles**: Turtles in the game appear in sets of two or three. You can jump on them when they are above the water, where they function like logs, supporting the frog. However, be cautious of turtles that dive underwater. If Frogger is still on a turtle when it dives, he will fall into the water and lose a life. To avoid this, players must leap to another floating object before the turtles submerge. Additionally, if you jump to the left or right off the edge of a turtle group, Frogger will also fall into the water, leading to the loss of a life.

_Diving Turtles:_

<div align="center">

![turtles](./images/turtle.png)

</div>

- **Alligator Jaws**: Beware of logs with hidden alligator jaws. They are alligators disguised as logs. The thing that differentiates them from the logs is their jaws. You can jump on the alligator's back safely, but if Frogger jumps into the alligator's open jaw, the user loses a life. Every second, the alligator clacks its jaw, when the jaws are closed, the frogger can walk on the alligator's head.

_Alligator:_

<div align="center">

![alligator](./images/alligator.png)

</div>

- **Otters**: These creatures swim rapidly and can snatch Frogger off floating objects, adding an extra layer of challenge for the player. They only start appearing after level 3. Every second, they perform a brief swimming animation, signaling their presence and keeping players on their toes.

_Otters:_

<div align="center">

![otter](./images/otter.png)

</div>

If Frogger falls into the river, the player loses a life, as the frog cannot swim.

#### 2.2.5 River Banks

At the top of the screen, there are five home bays that Frogger must safely reach to complete a level. However, some bays may occasionally be blocked by hazards, such as alligator heads. If a bay is blocked, the player must wait or aim for a different one. Once Frogger successfully reaches a home bay, that bay becomes unavailable for the rest of the level, and the player must fill the remaining bays to advance.

Reaching a home bay grants **50 points**, and players can earn bonus points if a fly or pink frog appears, as explained in the next section. The player must navigate all five frogs to the home bays to complete a level.

_River banks:_

<div align="center">

![goal](./images/goal.png)

</div>

- **Filling the home bay:**
  - When the player reaches a home bay, a frog is placed inside it. Once filled, the player cannot enter that home bay again. If the player attempts to jump into a home bay that has already been filled, Frogger will lose a life.

<div align="center">

![homebay frog](./images/froghome.png)
![frog in bay](./images/froginbay.png)

</div>

On the upper river bank, one enemy can spawn:

- **Alligator's head**: If an alligator's head is showing in a home bay, it is not safe to enter it. Jumping into it will result in the death of a frog. However, if the alligator just appeared, there's a 2-second safe period before being deadly.

_Alligator's head:_

<div align="center">

![goal with enemies](./images/goal_enemies.png)

</div>

On the lower river bank and the logs, one more enemy can spawn after level 3:

- **Snakes**: They are deadly enemies spawning randomly on the logs and the lower river bank. It goes from left to right. If a snake touches the frog, it will lead to the death of the frog. The snake has a moving animation, as shown below, that changes every clock cycle.

_Snake:_

<div align="center">

</div>

### 2.3 Bonuses

In "Frogger," players can increase their score through special bonuses scattered throughout the game. The key bonuses are as follows:

#### 2.3.1 Pink Frog

- Occasionally, a pink "lady" frog appears on a log within the river.
- Lady moves from left to right on the log she's on.
- To earn bonus points, players must jump onto the log with the pink frog and safely guide her to a home bay.
- Successfully bringing the pink frog home grants the player **200 bonus points**.

_Pink frog:_

<div align="center">

![pink frog](./images/pink_frog.png)

</div>

#### 2.3.2 Fly Bonus

- A fly may appear in one of the home bays at random intervals.
- Players can earn additional points by hopping Frogger into the home bay with the fly.
- Collecting the fly rewards the player with **200 bonus points**.

_Flies:_

### 2.4 Game Difficulty

The difficulty in "Frogger" escalates across four distinct levels. Here’s a breakdown of what to expect at each level:

#### Game Levels (1-8)

- **Level 1**:

  - At the start, Frogger can float off-screen for a frame, allowing for a moderate introduction to the gameplay.
  - Traffic patterns are manageable, with vehicles moving across the screen with periodically larger gaps. Players will have time to learn the timing of their movements without the pressure of fast-moving obstacles.
  - River obstacles, such as logs and turtles, are plentiful, and the players will have ample opportunities to practice hopping safely across the water.
  - As players progress through these levels, the speed of traffic and river objects gradually increases.

- **Level 2**:

  - Alligators start to appear in the river alongside the logs.
  - The frog can walk on the alligator's back but the Frogger dies when it walks on the alligator's head.

- **Level 3 & 4**:
  - In these advanced levels, Frogger can no longer float off-screen.
  - The game starts at a higher difficulty, with traffic being denser and logs more sparse.
  - New hazards are introduced, such as **otter attacks** that can push frogger into the water.
  - With fewer floating objects in the river, players must navigate a more treacherous environment.
- **Level 5 to 8**
  - After these levels, the speed increases sharply.
  - The density of traffic is lower but will increase again.

To proceed to the next level, the player must safely guide five frogs into the home bays. After completing all levels, the difficulty ramps up again.

- **Speed of objects in second to cross the screen**:

| Level | Lane1 | Lane2 | Lane3 | Lane4 | Lane5 | Turtle1 | Log1 | Log2 | Turtle2 | Log3 | Snakes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------- | ---- | ---- | ------- | ---- | ------ |
| 1     | 22    | 18    | 15    | 10    | 8     | 8       | 22   | 4    | 8       | 11   | /      |
| 2     | 22    | 18    | 15    | 10    | 8     | 8       | 22   | 4    | 8       | 11   | /      |
| 3     | 22    | 18    | 15    | 10    | 8     | 8       | 22   | 4    | 8       | 11   | 8      |
| 4     | 20    | 18    | 15    | 10    | 8     | 8       | 20   | 4    | 8       | 10   | 8      |
| 5+    | 8     | 12    | 8     | 2     | 10    | 4       | 20   | 8    | 12      | 8    | 8      |

Alligators have the same speed as the logs in the lane they are in.
Otters are 10% faster than the logs or turtles in the lane.

- **Density of cars and logs:**

### 2.5 Time Band

Frogger has a time limit of 30 seconds (or 60 ticks) to reach the home bay.
If the player fails to bring the frog to the home bay within this time, they will lose a life.
The remaining time is displayed as a time band at the bottom right of the screen.

_Time band_:

![time band](./images/timeband.png)

The time band gradually shrinks as time passes. When only 10 seconds (or 20 ticks) remain, the time band turns red to signal that time is running out, as shown below:

_Time running out_:

![red time band](./images/redtimeband.png)

### 2.6 Scoring System

Points are awarded for various actions within the game:

- **Jumping Frogger forward**: 10 points per forward jump.
- **Reaching a home bay**: 50 points.
- **Guiding all five frogs home**: 1,000 points.
- **Rescuing the pink frog**: 200 points.
- **Eating a fly**: 200 points.
- **Bonus points for remaining time**: 10 points per remaining tick.

If the player reaches a high score of 20,000 points and fewer than four frogs remain, an extra frog (life) is awarded.

| Action              | Points Earned                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Jump Forward        | +10 points                    |

| Beating A Level     | +1,000 points                 |
| Escorting Pink Lady | +200 points                   |
| Eating A Fly        | +200 points                   |
| Bonus Time          | +10 points \* ticks remaining |
| Score = 20,000      | 1 UP                          |

### 2.7 End of Game

The game ends when all of Frogger's lives are lost. At this point, the player can either restart the game or reset it using the FPGA system to begin a new round. Additionally, if the player successfully reaches the end of the 8th level, they will have beaten the game. They are redirected to the main menu.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

This section outlines the non-functional requirements for the FPGA Frogger game project, focusing on costs, performance, reliability, and testability.

### 3.1 Costs

##### Capital Expenditures

- **Board**: NandLand Go-Board, priced at $70 including VAT.
- **Monitor**: Acer EK251Q EBI, priced at $124.99 VAT.

The capital expenditures, including the board and monitor, are furnished by the school. There are no relevant development environment costs, as the project uses freely available software.

##### Time Invested

Since this is an educational project, significant time will be invested in learning Verilog and FPGA design. The goal is to both create a functional product and gain knowledge of the tools and hardware.

##### Operational Expenditures

As the project is entirely self-contained, running on the FPGA hardware, there are no cloud services, server usage, or ongoing maintenance costs. Operational expenditures are expected to be at a minimum after development.

##### Project Scope

The scope of this project is focused on learning FPGA and Verilog programming while building a fun, playable Frogger game. The cost needs to stay low as the primary objective is education.

### 3.2 Response/Performance & Reliability

This section defines how quickly and reliably the system responds to user inputs and renders changes on the screen.

##### Performance Metrics

- **VGA Display**: The game runs at a 640x480 resolution, there will be smooth transitions between game objects while adhering to VGA timing constraints. Clear visuals and a consistent refresh rate are expected.
- **Target FPS**: The game aims for a frame rate of 30 FPS without screen tearing.
- **Input Latency**: The frog’s movement should occur within 10 to 30 milliseconds of pressing a button.
- **Object Movement**: Vehicles and obstacles must move fluidly across the screen without jittering. Object speeds will vary by difficulty, but all movements should be smooth and reliable.

##### Failure modes

- If all four buttons are pressed at once the game restart.
- If two or more input are made at the same time the output is combined. eg. Left and Up would be a diagonal.

##### Reliability Considerations

- **Error Handling**: The system needs to handle unexpected conditions, such as edge cases like simultaneous button presses. The game will reset or retry if these occur.
- **Stability**: The game should not crash or freeze during normal gameplay, the players need to be able to complete the game without technical issues.

### 3.3 Testability

Testability refers to how easily the system's functionality can be verified. A comprehensive test plan is being developed by a team member. The testing process will cover both simulation and in-hardware testing, with manual gameplay serving as the primary method due to the project's hardware setup.

### 3.4 Documentation

- **Definition:** The quality and comprehensiveness of documentation provided to aid in learning, future reference, and ensuring that the project’s goals, scope, and ambitions are clearly communicated. The documentation must align with our vision for the software.

- **Considerations:**

  - **Comprehensive Documentation:** Our team will ensure that all of the documentation of the project is comprehensive for everyone by having clear English.
  - **Code Documentation:** CCode should be easily readable and commented with purpose. Ensuring comprehensiveness and clarity in the software. As Verilog is a low-level language, clarity will be necessary.

### 3.5 Flexibility

- **Definition:** Flexibility refers to the system's ability to accommodate future enhancements, evolving user needs, and minor adjustments without requiring major rework.

  In this project, flexibility ensures that the game remains reprogrammable over time, allowing for potential feature additions such as new levels, difficulty settings, or user-requested improvements.

- **Considerations:**
  - **Feature Extensions:** Although our team won't provide post-project support, the game’s design must allow future developers to easily modify and extend its functionalities.
  - **Bug Fixes:** A flexible system also simplifies the process of addressing bugs, enabling developers to efficiently implement fixes without needing to overhaul the software structure.

## 4. Risks and Assumptions

### 4.1 Risks

| **Risk**                 | **Impact** | **Mitigation**                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hardware Failure**     | High       | Regular testing of hardware components and keeping backup components available to minimize downtime.                                                                |
| **Software Development** | Medium     | As Verilog is not designed for game development, thorough planning, and incremental testing will help manage issues, along with continued learning of the language. |

### 4.2 Budget considerations

As the game is being created from scratch, there should not be any expenses related to the software creation. However, there may be a need to spend some money on unforeseen components or enhancements. It’s important to note that while the FPGA board and VGA monitor were provided by the school, future users of the project will need to obtain these components themselves. We reserve the right to recommend specific functionalities if deemed necessary.
